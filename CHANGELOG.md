Publishing to JSR.

1.0.0
=====

Released: March 31, 2023

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking API changes.  
  Lots of work here to really simplify and minimize the API surface area.
* More documentation.
* Better tests.
* Laid groundwork for dynamic imports.  
  More APIs are async, so that they won't have to change if/when dynamic module
  loading is added. This is currently blocked. 
  See: <https://github.com/NfNitLoop/deno-embedder/issues/6>
